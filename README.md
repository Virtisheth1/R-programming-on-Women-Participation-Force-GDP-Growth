# R-programming-on-Women-Participation-Force-GDP-Growth

In our project titled "# R-programming-on-Women-Participation-Force-GDP-Growth," we embarked on a comprehensive analysis using The World Bank's 2019 dataset. Our primary aim was to delve into the influence of women's participation in the labor force on a country's economic growth over time. Leveraging multiple econometric tools and techniques, we meticulously crafted our analytical approach.

Applying multiple regression, we structured our analysis, incorporating an array of control variables to substantiate the causality of the estimated effects. The decision-making regarding the functional form ranged from log-specifications to linear models, factoring in considerations like skewness in variable distributions. We explored the viability of polynomials versus linearity and introduced interaction effects between variables to explore nuanced causal relationships.

The utilization of continuous and dummy variables was methodical, ensuring that variables lacking quantitative significance were represented appropriately. Additionally, we considered binary variable models, particularly useful when the dependent variable was binary. To address complexities like reverse causality or unobserved omitted variables, we explored instrumental variable (IV) approaches and panel data methods.

A cornerstone of our approach was a rigorous sensitivity analysis, evaluating the robustness of our empirical model. This involved testing various scenarios such as replacing continuous variables with dummies, introducing additional control variables, and estimating on subsamples of the dataset. These analyses helped fortify the credibility and reliability of our findings, validating the consistency and integrity of our chosen empirical model.
